This is my personal website. You can navigate the tabs at the top for more information. This is a work-in-progress. It will be continuously updated in the near future.

## Research Interests
Generally, I am interested in the various scales of physical and chemical phenomena. Particularly, the description of macroscopic scale phenomena using the various scales of computational and experimental techniques available. This research generates fundamental knowledge about the phenomena of interest which is essential for material sciences characterizations and engineering applications.<br>

Below is a representation of some samples of my research and where they are located in the spectrum of length and time scales.<br>
